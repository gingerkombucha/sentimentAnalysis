# sentimentAnalysis

Here sentiment analysis is used to help understand newspaper vent lines from Charleston Gazette-Mail. 

In the first output, emotion categories are ranked and color coded. We can tell that the sentiment “joy” has the highest rate of expression after “unknown”, although that is debatable because when we read the actual newspaper vent lines from Charleston Gazette-Mail, a lot of the sentiments are contextual and what might sound joyous, could actually just be a passive way of expressing anger or other emotions. “Anger” is followed by joy, then “sadness,” “fear,” and “surprise.”

In the next output/graph, the polarity of the vent lines are assessed based on three categories: negative, positive, and neutral. Here, again, “positive” has the highest rate, followed by negative, and then neutral(middle white).

The third output just highlights the keywords used in the vent lines based on the levels of the emotions or different sentiments themselves that are highlighted in grey; unknown, joy, anger, sadness, fear, surprise. As we can see, in the word cloud of the “joy” section, words like “good” are bigger in text showing their higher usage weight. In the “anger” section, words like “problem” and “guns” are highlights. Same is the case with other emotion levels.
